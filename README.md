Awesome list for embedded security tools and knowledge

## Software Tools

### Binary Parsing and Analysis Tools
* [Kaitai Struct](https://kaitai.io/) - Kaitai Struct is a declarative language used to describe various binary data structures, laid out in files or in memory: i.e. binary file formats, network stream packet formats, etc.
* [Binwalk](https://github.com/ReFirmLabs/binwalk) - Binwalk is a fast, easy to use tool for analyzing, reverse engineering, and extracting firmware images.
* [OFRAK](https://github.com/redballoonsecurity/ofrak) - OFRAK is a binary analysis and modification platform that combines the ability to unpack, analyze, modify, and repack binaries.

### Disassember/Decompilers
* [IDA Pro](https://hex-rays.com/ida-pro/) - IDA Pro as a disassembler is capable of creating maps of their execution to show the binary instructions that are actually executed by the processor in a symbolic representation (assembly language). Advanced techniques have been implemented into IDA Pro so that it can generate assembly language source code from machine-executable code and make this complex code more human-readable.
* [Vivisect](https://github.com/vivisect/vivisect) - A combined disassembler/static analysis/symbolic execution/debugger framework.
* [Binary Ninja](https://binary.ninja/) - Binary Ninja is an interactive disassembler, decompiler, and binary analysis platform for reverse engineers, malware analysts, vulnerability researchers, and software developers that runs on Windows, macOS, and Linux.
* [Cutter](https://cutter.re/) - Free and Open Source RE Platform powered by Rizin
* [Rizin](https://rizin.re/) - A free and open-source Reverse Engineering framework, providing a complete binary analysis experience with features like Disassembler, Hexadecimal editor, Emulation, Binary inspection, Debugger, and more.
* [radare2](https://www.radare.org/n/) - A free/libre toolchain for easing several low level tasks like forensics, software reverse engineering, exploiting, debugging. It is composed by a bunch of libraries (which are extended with plugins) and programs that can be automated with almost any programming language.
* [Ghidra](https://ghidra-sre.org/) - A software reverse engineering (SRE) suite of tools developed by NSA's Research Directorate in support of the Cybersecurity mission.
* [Angr Management](https://github.com/angr/angr-management) - Angr is a multi-architecture binary analysis toolkit, with the capability to perform dynamic symbolic execution (like Mayhem, KLEE, etc.) and various static analyses on binaries. If you'd like to learn how to use it, you're in the right place!

### Language Specific Decompilers
* .NET
  * [ILSpy](https://github.com/icsharpcode/ILSpy) - .NET Decompiler with support for PDB generation, ReadyToRun, Metadata (&more) - cross-platform!
  * dnSpy
  * de4dot
* Java
  * JD-GUI
  * JADX

### Security Auditing Frameworks
* [EXPLIoT](https://pypi.org/project/expliot/) - EXPLIoT is a Framework for security testing and exploiting IoT products and IoT infrastructure. It provides a set of plugins (test cases) which are used to perform the assessment and can be extended easily with new ones. The name EXPLIoT (pronounced expl-aa-yo-tee) is a pun on the word exploit and explains the purpose of the framework i.e. IoT exploitation.
* [Metasploit](https://www.metasploit.com/) - Knowledge is power, especially when it’s shared. A collaboration between the open source community and Rapid7, Metasploit helps security teams do more than just verify vulnerabilities, manage security assessments, and improve security awareness; it empowers and arms defenders to always stay one step (or two) ahead of the game.
* [Firmware Analysis and Comparison Tool (FACT)](https://fkie-cad.github.io/FACT_core/) - The Firmware Analysis and Comparison Tool (FACT) is intended to automate Firmware Security analysis (Router, IoT, UEFI, Webcams, Drones, …). Thereby it shall be easy to use (web UI), extend (plug-in system) and integrate (REST API).

## RF Tools

* [Flipper Zero](https://flipperzero.one/) - Flipper Zero is a portable multi-tool for pentesters and geeks in a toy-like body. It loves hacking digital stuff, such as radio protocols, access control systems, hardware and more. It's fully open-source and customizable, so you can extend it in whatever way you like.
